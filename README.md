# set-up-webpack
In this project, I refactored the Awesome books app code. The goal is to make it more organized by using modules. My ES6 knowledge was also put to test.

## Description
> Built a simple yet powerful webpack boilerplate, to be used later as a starting point in my projects. I'll be working with the webpack official guides.

- Lighthouse (An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more).

- Webhint (A customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your code for bestpractices and common errors).
